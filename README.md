# Full Alta Body Type

A tiny Starbound mod meant as an addon for [My Enternia](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia).

## Description

It changes alta body type to a curvier version, back how it was before 2.3.3b.

A few pixels different from the original, but some people might prefer this variant instead.
